# What company should you choose？

Many graduates divide companies into two categories:

* Large company
* Small company

In fact, this classification method has limitations. We should divide companies into two categories:

* Good company
* Small company

or more detailed:

* Good big company
* Bad big company
* Good small company
* Bad small company

What's their priority?

**Good small company>Good big company>Bad small company>Bad big company**

We shorten it as **GS>GB>BS>BB**

# Why is the priority like this?

GS: GS usually has a leadership boss and great employees. GS must be as small as a dozen or even a few people to ensure you have room for personal talent. If you are fortunate enough to join such GS, not only you do have plenty of opportunities to develop your talent, you will also have the opportunity to become the original shareholder in the future to obtain the most company's development bonus if your performance is good enough.Of course, risks and opportunities coexist.

GB: GB refers to industry giants. For example, Alibaba in the IT industry. Industry giants mean they have strong leaders to protect company development, many excellent talent to protect your improvement, a lot of money to protect your treatment, a sound system to protect your development. Cool under the big trees.

BS and BB: Why BS has higher priority than BB? This is not because BS is good, but BB is too bad.
