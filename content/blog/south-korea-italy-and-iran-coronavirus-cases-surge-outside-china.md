At the same time, South Korea is seeing a drastic jump in coronavirus cases apparently tied to people who attend a specific church, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. South Korean officials are investigating the church's members, who they say account for two-thirds of the total number of cases reported in South Korea, which has surpassed 200.
