A major effort to expand development of Canada’s oil sands has collapsed shortly before a deadline for government approval, undone by investor concerns over oil’s future and the political fault lines between economic and environmental priorities.

在政府同意的最后期限之前，扩大加拿大油砂开采的所做的主要努力已经失败，撤销的原因是投资者对石油的未来以及政府对经济和环境之间的优先顺序采取的错误路线感到担忧。

Nine years in the planning, the project would have increased Canada’s oil production by roughly 5 percent. But it would have also slashed through 24,000 acres of boreal forest and released millions of tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide every year.

经过九年的规划，该工程本可以使得加拿大的石油产量增加大约5%。但这也本将砍伐24,000英亩的森林和每年排放百万吨级的温室气体二氧化碳。

* slash 砍伐

Some Canadian oil executives had predicted that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet would approve the project by a regulatory deadline this week, though with burdensome conditions. But in a letter released Sunday night, the Vancouver-based developer, Teck Resources, declared that “there is no constructive path forward.”

有些加拿大的石油的高管曾预测，首席长官贾斯汀·特鲁多和他的内阁，将在本周监管规定的最后期限前批准该项目，不过会附加一些繁琐的条件。但是根据周日晚间释放的消息，总部位于温哥华的开发商泰克资源声称“那是一条没有建设性的道路”。

* cabinet 内阁

The unexpected withdrawal relieves Mr. Trudeau of a choice that was sure to anger environmentalists or energy interests, if not both.

这出人意料的撤销让特鲁多先生松了一口气，因为他本来的选择无疑会触怒环境保护者或者能源利益集团，即使不是同时激怒两者。
