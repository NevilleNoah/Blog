Earlier this month, temperatures in Antarctica appeared to reach a record-breaking 64.9 degrees Fahrenheit, matching the temperature in Los Angeles that day. New images released by NASA show the dramatic ice melt caused by the heat wave, a phenomenon that is becoming more and more common in the peninsula.

月初，根据Los Angeles监测的温度，南极洲的温度达到了打破了64.9华氏度的纪录。NASA发布的新图片显示了南极洲由热量引起的冰川急剧融化，这种现象在半岛变得也来越普遍。

NASA's Earth Observatory released two new images Friday by the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 that show the difference on the Eagle Island ice cap between February 4 and February 13.

NASA的地球天文台周五发布了两张由土地运转图像采集者在地球资源卫星8号拍摄的两张最新的图片，图像显示了鹰岛在2月4号和2月13号之间冰盖的差异。

The before-and-after snapshots show a dramatic decrease in ice and snow along the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula. In the later shot, a large portion of the ground is visible, as are bright blue melted ponds in the center of the island.

前后快照显示了南极洲的半岛的北端上的冰雪显著减少。在较迟拍摄的快照中，可以很明显地看到很大一部分裸露的土地，以及岛屿中央明亮的蓝色池塘。

Eagle Island is only about 25 miles from Argentina's Esperanza research base, which recorded the potentially record-high temperature on February 6. According to NASA climate models, the island experienced peak melt — about 1 inch — on that same day, leading to a loss of 4 inches total in a one-week period.

鹰岛距离阿根廷希望研究基地只有25英里，他们记录了2月6日潜在的创纪录的高温。根据NASA气候模型，该岛经历了融化的峰值，在同一天内融化了1英寸，高温峰值导致在一周的时间内总共融化了4英寸。
